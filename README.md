# Data Analytics Power BI Report 

This project aims to create a quarterly report for a medium-sized international retailer as a high-level business summary tailored for C-Suite executives, giving insight into high value customers.

### Phase 1 - Importing the Data 
All data had to be transformed with columns renamed to align with Power BI naming conventions. 

#### Orders Table 

Contains information about orders with one product code per order. This was imported via Azure SQL Database. 

* Order Date and Shipping Date columns were split to create Order Time and Shipping Time columns 
* Rows with missing order dates were removed 

#### Products Dimension (dim) Table

Contains information about the products sold by the company including price and weight. This was imported as a .csv file. 

* The Remove Duplicates function was used on the product_code column to ensure codes were unique 

#### Stores dim Table

Contains location information about each store. This was imported via Azure Blob Storage. 

* Column Profile was selected to see which regions were mispelled in the Region column
* The Replace Values function was used to replace mispelled versions of Europe and America

#### Customers Table 

Contains customer information including email address and address for each operating region. This was a zip folder containing 3 .csv files - it was imported as a folder and the data combined into one query. 

* A new column was created to combine first name and last name to make full name


### Phase 2 - Creating the Data Model 

A date table had to be created to allow time intelligence analysis with continuous date data covering the whole time period from the earliest Orders[Order Date] to the latest Orders[Shipping Date]. 
        Dates = CALENDAR(MIN(Orders[Order Date]), MAX(Orders[Shipping Date]))
        Day of Week = FORMAT(Dates[Date], "dddd")
        Month Name = FORMAT(Dates[Date], "MMMM")
        Month Number = MONTH(Dates[Date])
        Quarter = QUARTER(Dates[Date])
        Year = YEAR(Dates[Date])
        Start of Week = Dates[Date] - WEEKDAY(Dates[Date],2) + 1 #Â the 2 signals 2 as the start of the week (Monday) subtracting the weekday number from the date, it becomes the start of the week at the +1 (Sunday is the default start of the week)
        Start of Month = STARTOFMONTH(Dates[Date])
        Start of Quarter = STARTOFQUARTER(Dates[Date])
        Start of Year = STARTOFYEAR(Dates[Date])

The table was maked as date table under table tools tab. 

Some relationships had to be manually put together in a one-to-many relationship in single filter direction to form the star schema. 

* Products[product_code] to Orders[product_code]
* Stores[store code] to Orders[Store Code]
* Customers[User UUID] to Orders[User ID]
* Dates[date] to Orders[Order Date] - this had to be activated 
* Dates[date] to Orders[Shipping Date]

A new measures table was created to organise all of my measures and keep them under one table. I created an empty table using DAX formula to hold the measures under. 
= #table({"Measure_1"}, {{1}}) 
This created a one column, one row table. 

The following key measures were created: 
* 'Total Orders' -> counts the number of orders in the Orders table
        Total Orders = COUNTROWS(Orders)
* 'Total Revenue' -> multiplies the Orders[Product Quantity] column by the Products[Sale_Price] column for each row, and then sums the result - uses RELATED function to allow selection of multiple related tables 
        Total Revenue = SUMX(Orders, (Orders[Product Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Sale Price]))
* 'Total Profit' -> For each row, subtract the Products[Cost_Price] from the Products[Sale_Price], and then multiply the result by the Orders[Product Quantity], Sums the result for all rows
        Total Profit = SUMX(Orders, (RELATED(Products[Sale Price]) - RELATED(Products[Cost Price])) * Orders[Product Quantity])
* 'Total Customers' -> counts the number of unique customers in the Orders table. To account for filtering I utilised the CALCULATE function to override existing filters.
        Total Customers = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[User ID]))
* 'Total Quantity' -> counts the number of items sold in the Orders table
        Total Quantity = SUM(Orders[Product Quantity])
* 'Profit YTD' -> calculates the total profit for the current year
        Profit YTD = TOTALYTD([Total Profit], Dates[Date])
* 'Revenue YTD' -> calculates the total revenue for the current year
        Revenue YTD = TOTALYTD([Total Revenue], Dates[Date])

Hierarchies aid visualisations so I created a date hierarchy to drill-down in my line charts from start of year, to the day. A geography-based hierachy was also created to allow filtering by region, country and province. 

New calculated columns were created in the stores column to add to the geography hierarchy. Country codes were translated to Country name using x2 IF statements: 
        Country = IF(Stores[Country Code] = "GB", "United Kingdom", IF(Stores[Country Code] = "US", "United States", "Germany"))
In addition to the country column, a full geography column was created to make mapping more accurate. The formula for this column was: 
        Geography = Stores[Country Region] & ", " & Stores[Country]
